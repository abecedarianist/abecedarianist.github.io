		<h2><u>Poet Tree</u></h2>
		
		<p class='poem'>
        Does each branch of a tree <br>
		Each twisting beauty of asymmetry<br>
		Feel itself unfree?<br><br>
		
		It both depends and is depended on;<br>
		It both extends and is extended from—<br>
		
		One part of one great tree;<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='zhong'>一棵在林森里</span>,<br><br>
		
		Like you, of course, and me<br>
		One pair in this great human-verse<br>
		That sometimes rhymes but often hurts<br>
		一Yet even when life seems its worst<br>
		We still might laugh in fits and bursts;<br><br>
		
		The branch just lives, and loves the sun;一<br>
		He trusts the spring will always come.<br>
