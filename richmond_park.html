		<p class='poem'>
        Apart from the deer, the drivers and diners<br />
        In a grove that plateaus to a covered cove, quiet vista'd<br />
        Summers I sat, the mildest of blisters<br>
		Being just that. <br> <br>
		O high in all ways then I <br>
		Fiddled with words through the stages of the sun, won <br>
		Synecdoches to the soul's plenum— <br>
		Yea cares kept none. <br> </br/>
		—Yet still I knew that that perfect biome</br/>
		Was all too partial. . . oft as I wandered home</br/>
		Buoyed only by buddhist blandishments, I felt other minds</br/>
		Encincture my mind; </br/></br/>
		Knew that this world was the world of many, that much of that folk</br/>
		Still laboured under my indirect yoke,</br/>
		Strained to sustain my imperial dividend, now more than ever</br/>
		Skirt in moral weakness. </br/>
