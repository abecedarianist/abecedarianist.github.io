		<h2 style> Three Poems for Yuan</h2><br>
		
		<h3> <u> 'It is a small and perfect thing' </u> </h3>
		
		<p class='poem'>
        It is a small and perfect thing <br>
		This ring which on my body swings<br>
		And when I hold it to my chest<br>
		I know it mingles too, upon your breast<br>
		For you brought it to me from Tibet<br>
		Now years and years ago<br>
		And when I feel faint or oppressed<br>
		I hold it to my heart, and rest.<br><br><br>
		</p>
		
		
		<h3><u>Poet Tree</u></h2>
		
		<p class='poem'>
        Does each branch of a tree <br>
		Each twisting beauty of asymmetry<br>
		Feel itself unfree?<br><br>
		
		It both depends and is depended on;<br>
		It both extends and is extended from—<br>
		
		One part of one great tree;<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class='zhong'>一棵在林森里</span>,<br><br>
		
		Like you, of course, and me<br>
		One pair in this great human-verse<br>
		That sometimes rhymes but often hurts<br>
		一Yet even when life seems its worst<br>
		We still might laugh in fits and bursts;<br><br>
		
		The branch just lives, and loves the sun;一<br>
		He trusts the spring will always come.<br><br><br>
		</p>
		
		
		<h3><u> 'It is too much too think of you' </u></h2>
		
		
		<p class='too_much'>
        It is too much to think of you <br> <br>
		&emsp;&nbsp;Too much the doors hold sway <br> <br>
		&ensp;Too much to keep, fixed, in some words <br> <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Too much, even, to dream away <br> <br>
		&emsp;Too much the gap of space and time <br> <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Two borders binding blind  <br> <br>
		&emsp;&ensp;Two twining souls, like trees in chinese scrolls<br> <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Two hearts, two hearths, two minds <br> <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Two coasts that never meet <br> 
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Two sighs swell sea skies sweep
