        Hardseated through the second septile of this City <br>
		Across the laundried balconies and birdless tops of trees <br>
		And distance that recedes <br>
		In smog or foggy mistery<br>
		(a metaphor for this City’s muted sense of history)<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;—Until, as irresistibly<br>
		As tannoy prompts are leavened in the mind<br>
		Windows refract delved darkness, doppel dimly<br>
		Trite urbanites in facemasks thumbing phones. . .<br><br>

		. . .we left to take line seven. First pushing through <br>
		Thronged crowds with no concept of <i> after you</i>;—<br>
		So simple etiquette, and strays that folk hereticate <br>
		Emerge as medleys from exposure’s loom: the bloom <br>
		Of love in public is a feigned taboo; frankness<br>
		Personally’s most thankless,<br>
		—Conceptually’s the way (so call a pig’s guts <i> pig guts, </i> <br>
		Sleep <i>the excreta of the eye, </i> nor strain to try <br>
		Devising logorrhoeas while your bowels stay dry. . .);<br>
		Also, as time ofttimes attests, it’s tasteless to assess<br>
		All promised plans as earnestly professed; and though <br>
		Deep steady drinking sure friendship expresses,<br>
		Few faux pars lewder come than boozed excesses;—<br>
		Nor should sneezing corral <i>god blesses, </i><br>
		And neither need one know the names of those with whom one messes—<br>
		(The sole third person pronoun here never ever distresses)<br>
		But as eternal guest, where jokes still cause arrests <br>
		Patient curiosity is best.<br><br>

		. . .then past the flowers in vending machines,<br>
		The cafés that don’t sell caffeine, <br>
		The fake bamboo, the eyes that ogle you<br>
		(Foreigners they’ve all seen quite a few,<br>
		But foreigners with local girls are much ado—)<br>
		Till down the escalators on the right we go,—<br>
		&emsp;&ensp;Automata in fluvial flow<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;Flooding caverns as shuttles stow <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;Chthonic echoes echoing slow. . . <br><br>

		On such rote journeys reason sows<br>
		Its seeds of sense in rhyme and lets them grow;<br>
		In syllambles the mind then mucks hoed fun<br>
		Deflooring fertile thoughts from soiled puns.<br><br>
										 
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;As in<br>
		This deepest façardicity—<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(The oxymoron’s apt<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For a state whose bodies are in fact<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In democratic trappings hardly wrapt—)<br>
		Of blackguards to nark each park and neighbourhood estate <br>
		That ever antithetic couplets brightly rubricate. . . <br><br>

		Here signs sublime some supposed synergy <br>
		Where west Nanjing streams east straight through north Urumqi<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;(The reality is rather street and city policed in symmetry,<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Perpetual forces forcing perpetuity. . .)<br><br>

		—Since all proceeds here by ensign (meaning stabilities<br>
		Succumb to fiat or its rumourous proclivities)<br>
		So all seems fixed in space and time: always asphalt,<br>
		Never gestalt; no slopes or verticalities; no buskers sabbathly;<br>
		No furores one might meet, chanting stamping feet;—<br>
		No churchmen to ignore, no chalk-arts on the floor,<br>
		Little to ponder or to muse upon, and the rich <br>
		Tucked neatly out sight. Limpidity. . .<br>
		As of an agèd sober whore. Call it <br>
		The mind shanghaied (her crew’s implied—);<br>
		—It is all too well defined, as if the streets <br>
		Themselves paved over all that peopled poetry of yore;<br>
		Those flights of fancy through old picture-books <br>
		Are no more. These commons heed their lord. Only<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Occasionally, one sees<br>
		A rickshaw stacked with scrap five meters high, or spies<br>
		A lonely Arab in his carpet shop. Hence coinage troops its trope:<br>
		<i>Poetics become byproduct of industry</i>. And see <br>
		Even temples have been gutted to sell luxuries—!<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;(Cowed Buddhists bowed when Dengists liberally <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Capitalised on those murderous cultural butcheries. . .)<br><br>

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Yet still this silken <br>
		Porcelain’s chinked with piecemeal poesies, for in <br>
		The semi-periphery, I found<br>
		Beneath a bridge to an unused canal <br>
		A florid throwie and three tags, and further north<br>
		A road-sweeper kicking her daughter in the spine.<br><br>

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;—Nor ought poets forget<br>
		That the shocking pity of that universally ignored <br>
		Phocomelic pauper rolling on her wooden board <br>
		Through footfall fleet, wet dusty heat <br>
		The stench of gutter oil and the open disjointing of meat <br>
		Is verse lest verse just pirouette. . .<br><br>

		. . .then we rose into the light <br>
		The sky a plain delight. And many the bright <br>
		Flowers planted in our sight. Whence, perambulating <br>
		Pleasantly through the gallery, whose myriad panoplies <br>
		Esteemed their cultures’ might (note that <br>
		Plural apostrophe—!) we wrought journey’s requite; then,	<br>				    
		&emsp;When weariness willed we let alight,<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Wandered back into that vernal glare<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;And on some shaded concrete spare <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;We sat, to rest within the People’s Square. . .<br><br>

		—Lay on my lap, warm hands caressed then warm black hair;<br>
		I watched the people strolling here and there,<br>
		Old youngsters on slow skateboards debonair,<br>
		Then grabbed a book——what scene could be more fair?  <br>
		Except, here comes (don’t say I didn’t warn you)<br>
		A heavy in his heavy clothes, quick from behind <br>
		Bored on the beat since morning:—<i>Get up, </i> not so <br>
		Rudely-as-prudely he demands, <i> beware 				<br>		
		The ways that you may not enjoy this air</i>.  <br><br>
																		
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;	Well, <br>
		Sometimes somethings somewhat impair <br>
		One’s strength to patch the wear and tear <br>
		Sustained through contact with a manifest unfair <br>
		Arbitrary power one cannot forbear:— you felt, justly<br>
		A relapsing despair. But hush. . . or rather let us laugh than swear  <br>
		At this absurdity of living where <br>
		Men roam the streets and earn their keep purely by being aware <br>
		Of any denizens not sitting sightly on their derrière!<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;—besides,<br>
		He’s just a lackey, one of those dozen everywhere. <br><br>

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Then anyway, being<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&ensp;Long occidentalised,<br>
		You lay back down. And soon enough <br>
		I caught another’s distant stare. But this time I was well-prepared:—<br>
		<i>She doesn’t feel too well. . .</i> I rusefully declared<br>
		(Lying about you lying as you lay in this lay—)<br>
		<i>—She doesn’t feel so well. . .?</i> And suddenly this human care <br>
		Triumphs over our outward form as he repairs<br>
		To trample that skating affair.<br><br>

		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;—but even so <br>
		One victory grants scant repose:— another will come <br>
		Usurp our little pleasure in the sun<br>
		Yet it wasn’t thus, when the state was young. . .<br><br>

		—Thither the contradictions: if the state were young <br>
		Could we be here, applauding Tosca sung<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;(All, of course, in perfect Italian—)?<br>
		Or on these tatami entwine gastronomies <br>
		Above an <i>ancient town</i> so newly travestied<br>
		That all its ancientness erodes under this sea <br>
		Of hawkers’ speakers spieling spurious commodities<br>
		To passersby who passim pause to ply posed profilitic oddities. . .?<br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;—Syllabled symbols silent sound.  <br><br>
		 
		. . .should I bring a cushion? ought I pad my trousers’ seat—?<br>
		Such thoughts no longer take me as we sweep <br>
		Through tunnels of the metro, the last train home <br>
		(—you meditating by my side eyes wide where no words roam. . .)<br>
		Nor does the faintly flickering trio <br>
		Of propaganda ads and those looping roblox safety videos <br>
		Distract me from this brooding on <br>
		How much I have let go. I raise <br>
		A subscription praise for what time slays.<br>
		You must change your life.<br>
