		<p class='too_much'>
        It is too much to think of you <br> <br>
		&emsp;&nbsp;Too much the doors hold sway <br> <br>
		&ensp;Too much to keep, fixed, in some words <br> <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Too much, even, to dream away <br> <br>
		&emsp;Too much the gap of space and time <br> <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Two borders binding blind  <br> <br>
		&emsp;&ensp;Two twining souls, like trees in chinese scrolls<br> <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Two hearts, two hearths, two minds <br> <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;Two coasts that never meet <br> 
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;Two sighs swell sea skies sweep
